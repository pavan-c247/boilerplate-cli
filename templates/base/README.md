# Next.js 15 Admin Dashboard Theme

A modern, scalable admin dashboard template built with [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/), [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/), TypeScript, and SCSS Modules. This project uses the App Router and a modular folder structure for maintainability and extensibility.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides a robust foundation for building admin dashboards and internal tools. It features:
- Modular, reusable React components
- Authentication flows (login, signup, forgot/reset password)
- Responsive layouts with sidebar, header, and main content
- Theming support (light/dark mode)
- Clean, maintainable code with TypeScript
- SCSS Modules for scoped, maintainable styles

The structure and patterns are designed for easy scaling and customization for any admin or dashboard use case.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

If your project requires environment variables (e.g., API endpoints, secrets), create a `.env.local` file in the root. Example:

```env
# Main API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_REST_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000/api

# MockAPI Configuration (shared for FAQ and CMS)
# Default: https://6853a9cea2a37a1d6f495380.mockapi.io/api/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCKAPI_BASE_URL=https://6853a9cea2a37a1d6f495380.mockapi.io/api/v1

# Security
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEXT_ENCRYPT_KEY=your-encryption-key
```

**Available Environment Variables:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_REST_API_ENDPOINT` - Main API endpoint for general services
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCKAPI_BASE_URL` - Shared MockAPI base URL for FAQ and CMS (fallback: provided MockAPI URL)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEXT_ENCRYPT_KEY` - Encryption key for cookies and sensitive data

Check the codebase for any usage of `process.env` to see which variables are required.

## 🧩 Modular Structure & Usage

- **Components** are organized by domain (auth, common, header-sidebar) for easy reuse and extension.
- **Auth flows** (login, signup, forgot/reset password) are modular and styled consistently using SCSS modules.
- **Theming** is handled via CSS variables and a ThemeProvider for light/dark mode.
- **Forms** use `react-hook-form` and custom Form/Input components for validation and accessibility.
- **Sidebar/Header** are fully responsive and support collapsible/expandable layouts.
- **Services** (e.g., `auth.ts`) encapsulate API logic for maintainability.

This structure makes it easy to:
- Add new pages or modules
- Swap out UI components
- Integrate with any backend
- Scale to large admin applications
